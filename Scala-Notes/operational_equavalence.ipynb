    "## **Operational equivalence**\n",
    "Operational equivalence in programming languages, including Scala, refers to the principle that two programs or expressions are considered equivalent if they always produce the same observable behavior. This principle is essential for reasoning about the correctness and efficiency of programs, especially in the context of program transformations, optimizations, and refactoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Observable Behavior:**\n",
    "   - Observable behavior refers to the external effects produced by a program, such as output produced, state changes, or interactions with the environment.\n",
    "   - Programs are operationally equivalent if they produce the same observable behavior for all possible inputs and contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example:**\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   // Example programs\n",
    "   def program1(x: Int): Int = x * 2\n",
    "   def program2(x: Int): Int = {\n",
    "     val y = x + 1\n",
    "     y * 2\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   // Operational equivalence\n",
    "   val input = 5\n",
    "   val result1 = program1(input)\n",
    "   val result2 = program2(input)\n",
    "\n",
    "   println(result1) // Output: 10\n",
    "   println(result2) // Output: 12\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, `program1` and `program2` are operationally equivalent because they both take an integer input `x` and produce an output that is twice the input plus 2. Despite the differences in their internal implementation, they produce the same observable behavior for the same input.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Importance:**\n",
    "   - Operational equivalence is crucial for program correctness and optimization. It allows developers and compilers to reason about the behavior of programs and make transformations that preserve the program's semantics.\n",
    "   - By ensuring that programs are operationally equivalent, developers can refactor code, optimize performance, and parallelize computations without changing the program's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **In Scala:**\n",
    "   - In Scala, operational equivalence is closely related to referential transparency and the substitution model of computation.\n",
    "   - Scala's functional nature encourages writing code that is operationally equivalent, which leads to more predictable and maintainable programs.\n",
