    "## `For` in scala \n",
    "In Scala, `for` comprehensions provide a concise way to work with sequences of elements, such as collections or other monadic types. They are syntactic sugar for `map`, `flatMap`, and `withFilter` operations. Here's how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Syntax:** The basic syntax of a `for` comprehension looks like a traditional `for` loop but is more powerful because it can work with various types, not just collections:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   for (pattern <- expression) yield result\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `pattern` is a variable pattern that matches elements of the sequence or monadic context.\n",
    "   - `expression` is the source sequence or monadic context.\n",
    "   - `result` is an expression that generates a new value based on each matched element.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example with Collections:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val numbers = Seq(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "   val squares = for (n <- numbers) yield n * n\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This will produce a new collection `squares` containing the squares of each number in `numbers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Filtering with `if`:** You can filter elements using an `if` clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val evenSquares = for (n <- numbers if n % 2 == 0) yield n * n\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will only include the squares of even numbers from `numbers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiple Generators:** You can have multiple generators, similar to nested loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val pairs = for {\n",
    "     x <- Seq(1, 2, 3)\n",
    "     y <- Seq('a', 'b', 'c')\n",
    "   } yield (x, y)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will generate a sequence of tuples with all combinations of `x` and `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Using `flatMap`:** When working with nested sequences, you can use `flatMap` to flatten the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val nestedNumbers = Seq(Seq(1, 2), Seq(3, 4), Seq(5, 6))\n",
    "   val flatNumbers = for {\n",
    "     innerSeq <- nestedNumbers\n",
    "     n <- innerSeq\n",
    "   } yield n\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will flatten `nestedNumbers` into a single sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use Cases:** `for` comprehensions are commonly used for data processing, especially when working with collections of data. They provide a more readable and concise way to perform operations compared to traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Beyond Collections:** While `for` comprehensions are often used with collections, they can also be used with other monadic types, such as `Option`, `Future`, and custom monads, to perform sequence-like operations in a concise manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Desugaring:** Under the hood, a `for` comprehension is desugared into `map`, `flatMap`, and `withFilter` operations, more on this in the translation of for notes file."
