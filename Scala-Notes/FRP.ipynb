    "## **Functional Reactive Programming**\n",
    "Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a paradigm for writing software that deals with asynchronous data streams and time-varying values. FRP is based on the concept of signals, which are values that change over time, and streams, which are sequences of values over time. FRP allows developers to declaratively define how these signals and streams are transformed and combined, leading to more concise and maintainable code for handling complex asynchronous behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts in FRP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Signals:** Signals represent time-varying values. They can be thought of as functions of time, where the value of the signal at any point in time is the current value of the function. Signals can be transformed and combined using various operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Streams:** Streams are sequences of values that change over time. They can be thought of as a series of events occurring over time. Streams can be created from various sources, such as user inputs, network events, or timer ticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Event Handling:** FRP provides abstractions for handling events in a declarative manner. Instead of imperatively registering event handlers, FRP allows developers to define how events should be processed using higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combinators:** FRP provides combinators, which are higher-order functions that operate on signals and streams. Combinators allow developers to combine and transform signals and streams in a declarative manner, leading to more concise and readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Time Handling:** FRP provides abstractions for handling time, such as timers and delays. These abstractions allow developers to define time-dependent behavior in a declarative manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in Scala using the Monix library:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "import monix.eval.{Task, TaskApp}\n",
    "import monix.reactive.Observable\n",
    "import monix.reactive.subjects.PublishSubject\n",
    "\n",
    "object FRPExample extends TaskApp {\n",
    "\n",
    "  def run(args: List[String]): Task[Unit] = {\n",
    "    val subject = PublishSubject[Int]\n",
    "\n",
    "    val observable = subject.map(_ * 2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    val subscription = observable.subscribe { value =>\n",
    "      println(s\"Received value: $value\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    Task.delay {\n",
    "      subject.onNext(1)\n",
    "      subject.onNext(2)\n",
    "      subject.onNext(3)\n",
    "      subscription.cancel() // Cancel the subscription\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "// for this example, we create a `PublishSubject` from the Monix library, which is a type of subject that acts as both an observer and an observable. We then create an `Observable` by mapping over the `PublishSubject` to double the values. Finally, we subscribe to the `Observable` to receive and print the transformed values.\n",
    "```\n",

    "## **Signals**\n",
    "In Functional Reactive Programming (FRP), signals represent values that change over time. They are a fundamental concept used to model dynamic behavior in reactive systems. Here are some examples of signals and how they can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mouse Position Signal**: A signal that represents the current position of the mouse cursor on the screen. This signal continuously updates as the mouse moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val mousePosition: Signal[(Int, Int)] = ???\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Counter Signal**: A signal that represents a counter that increments every second. This signal emits a new value every second.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val counter: Signal[Int] = Signal {\n",
    "     var count = 0\n",
    "     while (true) {\n",
    "       Thread.sleep(1000) // Wait for 1 second\n",
    "       count += 1\n",
    "       emit(count) // Emit the new count\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Button Click Signal**: A signal that represents clicks on a button. This signal emits a value whenever the button is clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val buttonClicks: Signal[Unit] = ???\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Temperature Signal**: A signal that represents the current temperature. This signal could be updated periodically based on sensor readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val temperature: Signal[Double] = ???\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **User Input Signal**: A signal that represents user input from a text field. This signal updates as the user types.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val userInput: Signal[String] = ???\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "## **The Mandelbrot set**\n",
    "The Mandelbrot set is a famous mathematical set of complex numbers that exhibits a visually stunning and intricate fractal shape. It is named after the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who studied and popularized fractals. The set is defined by iterating a simple mathematical formula on complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mandelbrot set is defined as the set of complex numbers \\(c\\) for which the function \\(f_c(z) = z^2 + c\\) does not diverge when iterated from \\(z = 0\\). In other words, starting from \\(z = 0\\), if the absolute value of \\(z\\) remains bounded for all iterations, then the complex number \\(c\\) is part of the Mandelbrot set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the iteration is:\n",
    "\\[ z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\(z_n\\) is the \\(n\\)th iteration of \\(z\\), and \\(c\\) is the complex number being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the Mandelbrot set, each point in the complex plane is assigned a color based on how quickly the iteration diverges. Points within the Mandelbrot set are typically colored black, while points outside the set are colored based on how quickly they diverge. This coloring technique produces the intricate and beautiful fractal patterns that are characteristic of the Mandelbrot set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple Scala program that generates an ASCII representation of the Mandelbrot set:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "object Mandelbrot {\n",
    "  def mandelbrot(c: (Double, Double)): Int = {\n",
    "    val maxIterations = 100\n",
    "    var z = (0.0, 0.0)\n",
    "    var n = 0\n",
    "    while (n < maxIterations && z._1 * z._1 + z._2 * z._2 < 4.0) {\n",
    "      val newZ = (z._1 * z._1 - z._2 * z._2 + c._1, 2.0 * z._1 * z._2 + c._2)\n",
    "      z = newZ\n",
