    "### **Functions with Recursion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself. In Scala, functions can be recursive, allowing for elegant solutions to problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def factorial(n: Int): Int =\n",
    "  if (n <= 1) 1\n",
    "  else n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "println(factorial(5)) // Output: 120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Higher-Order Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. They allow for a functional programming style, where functions are treated as first-class citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def applyFunction(f: Int => Int, x: Int): Int = f(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "val square = (x: Int) => x * x\n",
    "println(applyFunction(square, 5)) // Output: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Anonymous Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Anonymous functions, also known as lambda functions, are functions that are not bound to a name. They are useful for writing concise code, especially when passing functions as arguments to higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val addOne = (x: Int) => x + 1\n",
    "println(addOne(5)) // Output: 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Currying**\n",
    "\n",
    "Currying is a technique in which a function that takes multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions, each taking a single argument. It allows for partial application of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def add(x: Int)(y: Int): Int = x + y\n",
    "val addTwo = add(2) _ // Partial application\n",
    "println(addTwo(3)) // Output: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Tail Recursion & Tail Calls**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tail recursion is a special form of recursion where the recursive call is the last operation performed by the function. This allows the Scala compiler to optimize the recursion into a loop, avoiding stack overflow errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def factorial(n: Int, acc: Int = 1): Int =\n",
    "  if (n <= 1) acc\n",
    "  else factorial(n - 1, acc * n)\n",
    "\n",
    "println(factorial(5)) // Output: 120\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Finding Fixed Points**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding fixed points is a common problem in mathematics and computer science. In Scala, it can be done using functions and recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (using fixed-point combinator):\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def fixedPoint(f: Double => Double)(firstGuess: Double): Double = {\n",
    "  val tolerance = 0.0001\n",
    "  def isCloseEnough(x: Double, y: Double) =\n",
    "    Math.abs((x - y) / x) / x < tolerance\n",
    "  def iterate(guess: Double): Double = {\n",
    "    val next = f(guess)\n",
    "    if (isCloseEnough(guess, next)) next\n",
    "    else iterate(next)\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  iterate(firstGuess)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val sqrt = (x: Double) => fixedPoint(y => (y + x / y) / 2)(1.0)\n",
    "println(sqrt(2)) // Output: 1.4142135623746899\n",
    "```\n"
