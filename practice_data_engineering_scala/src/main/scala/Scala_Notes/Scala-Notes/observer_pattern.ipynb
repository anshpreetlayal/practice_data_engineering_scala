    "## **The Observer Pattern**\n",
    "The Observer Pattern, often utilized in imperative event handling, is a design pattern that facilitates communication between objects by defining a one-to-many dependency between them. In this pattern, when the state of one object (the subject) changes, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This enables loose coupling between the subject and its observers, allowing for better maintainability and extensibility of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Key Components:**\n",
    "   - **Subject:** The object being observed. It maintains a list of observers and notifies them of any state changes.\n",
    "   - **Observer:** The objects interested in the state changes of the subject. They register themselves with the subject and are notified when changes occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Workflow:**\n",
    "   - The subject maintains a collection of observers and provides methods to register, unregister, and notify observers.\n",
    "   - Observers register themselves with the subject to receive updates.\n",
    "   - When the subject's state changes, it notifies all registered observers by invoking a specific method on each observer.\n",
    "   - Observers then react to the notification by performing necessary actions based on the updated state of the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example:**\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   // Subject\n",
    "   class Button {\n",
    "     private var onClickListeners: List[() => Unit] = List()\n",
    "\n",
    "     def onClick(listener: () => Unit): Unit = {\n",
    "       onClickListeners ::= listener\n",
    "     }\n",
    "\n",
    "     def click(): Unit = {\n",
    "       // Simulate button click event\n",
    "       onClickListeners.foreach(_.apply())\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   // Observer\n",
    "   class Logger {\n",
    "     def logClick(): Unit = {\n",
    "       println(\"Button clicked!\")\n",
    "     }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "   // Usage\n",
    "   val button = new Button()\n",
    "   val logger = new Logger()\n",
    "\n",
    "   button.onClick(() => logger.logClick())\n",
    "\n",
    "   // Simulate button click\n",
    "   button.click() // Output: Button clicked!\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Benefits:**\n",
    "   - **Decoupling:** Subjects and observers are decoupled, making it easy to extend and maintain the codebase.\n",
    "   - **Reusability:** Observers can be reused across different subjects, promoting code reuse.\n",
    "   - **Flexibility:** Subjects can have varying numbers and types of observers, providing flexibility in the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Drawbacks:**\n",
    "   - **Memory Leak:** If observers are not properly unregistered, it can lead to memory leaks.\n",
    "   - **Performance Overhead:** Notifying all observers on every state change may introduce performance overhead in some scenarios.\n",
