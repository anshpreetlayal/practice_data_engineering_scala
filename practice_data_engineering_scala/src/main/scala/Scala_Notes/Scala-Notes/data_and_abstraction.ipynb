    "### 12. Functions and Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, functions and data can be closely tied together. Functions can operate on data, transforming it or generating new data based on existing data. This allows for a functional programming style, where functions are used to process and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "case class Person(name: String, age: Int)\n",
    "\n",
    "val people = List(\n",
    "  Person(\"Alice\", 30),\n",
    "  Person(\"Bob\", 25),\n",
    "  Person(\"Charlie\", 35)\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "val names = people.map(_.name)\n",
    "println(names) // Output: List(Alice, Bob, Charlie)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. Data Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of data structures and exposing only the essential features. In Scala, this is often achieved using classes and objects, where the internal representation of data is hidden behind a set of methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "class Counter {\n",
    "  private var value = 0\n",
    "  def increment(): Unit = value += 1\n",
    "  def getValue: Int = value\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val counter = new Counter\n",
    "counter.increment()\n",
    "println(counter.getValue) // Output: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. Self-reference (this, that)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, `this` is a keyword that refers to the current instance of a class. It can be used to access methods and fields of the current object. `that` is often used as a reference to another object, especially when dealing with method chaining or fluent interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "class Person(name: String) {\n",
    "  def introduce(): String = s\"My name is $name\"\n",
    "  def meet(other: Person): String = s\"${this.introduce()}, nice to meet you, ${other.name}\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val alice = new Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "val bob = new Person(\"Bob\")\n",
    "println(alice.meet(bob)) // Output: My name is Alice, nice to meet you, Bob\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. Pure Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure Booleans refer to boolean values that do not have any side effects. In functional programming, pure functions are preferred because they are easier to reason about and test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val isTrue = true\n",
    "val isFalse = false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. Pure Data (Algebraic Data Types)\n",
    "\n",
    "Algebraic data types (ADTs) are data types that can be constructed from other types using algebraic operations. In Scala, ADTs can be defined using case classes and sealed traits, allowing for pattern matching and concise data modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "sealed trait Shape\n",
    "case class Circle(radius: Double) extends Shape\n",
    "case class Rectangle(width: Double, height: Double) extends Shape\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17. Enums (Domain Modeling)\n",
    "\n",
    "Enums are a way to represent a fixed set of constants. In Scala, enums can be defined using sealed traits and case objects, allowing for pattern matching and type safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "sealed trait DayOfWeek\n",
    "case object Monday extends DayOfWeek\n",
    "case object Tuesday extends DayOfWeek\n",
    "case object Wednesday extends DayOfWeek\n",
    "case object Thursday extends DayOfWeek\n",
    "case object Friday extends DayOfWeek\n",
    "case object Saturday extends DayOfWeek\n",
    "case object Sunday extends DayOfWeek\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18. Sequences, Vectors, Ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequences, vectors, and ranges are different types of collections in Scala for storing sequences of elements. Sequences are ordered collections that can be indexed, vectors are similar to arrays but with better performance for certain operations, and ranges represent a range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val seq = Seq(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val vec = Vector(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val range = 1 to 5\n",
    "```\n"
