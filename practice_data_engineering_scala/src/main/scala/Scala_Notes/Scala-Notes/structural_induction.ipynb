    "## `Structural Induction on Trees:`\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural induction is a proof technique used to demonstrate properties of recursively defined data structures, such as trees. In the context of trees, structural induction involves proving that a property holds for all trees by breaking the proof into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case:** \n",
    "   - The base case involves proving that the property holds for the simplest forms of trees, typically the base cases of the recursive definition.\n",
    "   - For example, in a binary tree, the base cases might include an empty tree (`Empty`) or a leaf node (`Leaf`).\n",
    "   - To prove the base case, you demonstrate that the property holds for these simple cases without relying on the recursive structure of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inductive Step:**\n",
    "   - The inductive step involves assuming that the property holds for smaller instances of the tree (subtrees) and then proving that it holds for a larger instance (the entire tree).\n",
    "   - For example, in a binary tree, the inductive step might involve assuming that the property holds for the left and right subtrees of a node (`Node`) and then proving that it holds for the entire node.\n",
    "   - This step typically involves using the assumption of the property for the smaller instances to derive the property for the larger instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Let's consider a property of binary trees that states that the number of nodes in a tree is greater than or equal to the height of the tree. We can prove this property using structural induction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Case:** \n",
    "   - For an empty tree (`Empty`) or a leaf node (`Leaf`), the number of nodes is 0, and the height is 0.\n",
    "   - Therefore, the property holds for these base cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inductive Step:**\n",
    "   - Assume that the property holds for the left and right subtrees of a node (`Node`).\n",
    "   - Let `n` be the number of nodes in the left subtree, and `h` be the height of the left subtree.\n",
    "   - Similarly, let `m` be the number of nodes in the right subtree, and `k` be the height of the right subtree.\n",
    "   - The total number of nodes in the tree is `n + m + 1` (counting the current node), and the height of the tree is `max(h, k) + 1` (taking the maximum height of the subtrees and adding 1 for the current node).\n",
    "   - We need to show that `n + m + 1 >= max(h, k) + 1`, which simplifies to `n + m >= max(h, k)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Since `n >= h` and `m >= k` by the induction hypothesis (property holds for the subtrees), we have:\n",
    "     - `n + m >= h + k >= max(h, k)` (since `max(h, k)` is either `h` or `k`, whichever is larger).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Therefore, the property holds for the entire tree by induction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "```scala\n",
    "sealed trait Tree[A] // Define a sealed trait for a binary tree\n",
    "case class Node[A](value: A, left: Tree[A], right: Tree[A]) extends Tree[A] // Node with value and left and right subtrees\n",
    "case class Leaf[A](value: A) extends Tree[A] // Leaf node with a single value\n",
    "case object Empty extends Tree[Nothing] // Empty tree\n",
    "\n",
    "// Define a function to calculate the sum of all values in a tree\n",
    "def sumTree[A](tree: Tree[A])(implicit num: Numeric[A]): A = {\n",
    "  tree match {\n",
    "    case Empty => num.zero // Base case: Empty tree has sum zero\n",
    "    case Leaf(value) => value // Base case: Leaf node has the value as sum\n",
    "    case Node(value, left, right) =>\n",
    "      // Inductive step: Sum of a node is the value plus sum of left and right subtrees\n",
    "      val sumLeft = sumTree(left)\n",
    "      val sumRight = sumTree(right)\n",
    "      num.plus(value, num.plus(sumLeft, sumRight))\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Example usage\n",
    "val tree = Node(1, Node(2, Leaf(3), Leaf(4)), Leaf(5)) // Define a binary tree\n",
    "println(sumTree(tree)) // Output: 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)\n",
