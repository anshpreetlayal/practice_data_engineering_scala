    "## `Monads`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is a Monad?**\n",
    "   - A monad is a design pattern in functional programming that represents a computation or a sequence of steps. It provides a way to chain operations together, handling side effects and error handling in a predictable manner.\n",
    "   - In Scala, monads are implemented as types that adhere to the monadic laws and provide operations like `flatMap` and `map`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monad Laws:**\n",
    "   - **Left Identity:** `unit(x).flatMap(f)` is equivalent to `f(x)`.\n",
    "   - **Right Identity:** `m.flatMap(unit)` is equivalent to `m`.\n",
    "   - **Associativity:** `m.flatMap(f).flatMap(g)` is equivalent to `m.flatMap(x => f(x).flatMap(g))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Common Monad Operations:**\n",
    "   - `flatMap`: Used to chain operations together, taking a function that returns another monad.\n",
    "   - `map`: Similar to `flatMap`, but the function returns a non-monadic value.\n",
    "   - `unit` (or `pure`): Wraps a value into a monad, often called `return` in other languages.\n",
    "   - `getOrElse`: Extracts the value from the monad or provides a default value if the monad is empty.\n",
    "   - `filter`: Filters the monad based on a predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Examples of Monads in Scala:**\n",
    "   - **Option Monad:** Represents optional values that may or may not exist, providing safety against null pointer exceptions.\n",
    "     ```scala\n",
    "     val maybeValue: Option[Int] = Some(42)\n",
    "     val result = maybeValue.flatMap(v => if (v > 0) Some(v * 2) else None)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Future Monad:** Represents asynchronous computations, allowing composition of operations that run concurrently.\n",
    "     ```scala\n",
    "     import scala.concurrent.Future\n",
    "     import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global\n",
    "     val futureValue: Future[Int] = Future.successful(42)\n",
    "     val result = futureValue.flatMap(v => Future(v * 2))\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **List Monad:** Represents a collection of values, allowing operations on each element in the collection.\n",
    "     ```scala\n",
    "     val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "     val result = numbers.flatMap(n => List(n, n * 2))\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Creating Custom Monads:**\n",
    "   - To create a custom monad in Scala, define a type that implements `flatMap`, `map`, and adheres to the monadic laws.\n",
    "   - Example: Creating a `Maybe` monad that represents either a value or nothing.\n",
    "     ```scala\n",
    "     sealed trait Maybe[+A]\n",
    "     case class Just[A](value: A) extends Maybe[A]\n",
    "     case object Nothing extends Maybe[Nothing]\n",
    "\n",
    "     implicit class MaybeOps[A](value: Maybe[A]) {\n",
    "       def flatMap[B](f: A => Maybe[B]): Maybe[B] = value match {\n",
    "         case Just(v) => f(v)\n",
    "         case Nothing => Nothing\n",
    "       }\n",
    "\n",
    "       def map[B](f: A => B): Maybe[B] = value match {\n",
    "         case Just(v) => Just(f(v))\n",
    "         case Nothing => Nothing\n",
    "       }\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```"
