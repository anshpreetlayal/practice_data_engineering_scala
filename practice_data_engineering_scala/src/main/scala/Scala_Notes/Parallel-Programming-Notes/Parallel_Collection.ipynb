    "### **Parallelizable Collections**\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelizable collections in Scala are those that can be efficiently parallelized for concurrent processing. These collections provide methods or operations that can be executed in parallel, leveraging multiple processing units to improve performance. Examples of parallelizable collections in Scala include `ParArray`, `ParSeq`, `ParSet`, and `ParMap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val numbers = (1 to 1000000).toArray\n",
    "val parallelArray = numbers.par // Convert array to parallel collection\n",
    "val sum = parallelArray.fold(0)(_ + _) // Perform parallel fold operation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `numbers` is converted to a parallel array using the `par` method, allowing the `fold` operation to be executed in parallel, potentially speeding up the computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Non-Parallelizable Collections**\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-parallelizable collections in Scala are those that do not support efficient parallel processing. Operations on these collections are typically executed sequentially and cannot take advantage of parallelism. Examples of non-parallelizable collections include `List`, `Seq`, `Set`, and `Map`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val list = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val sum = list.fold(0)(_ + _) // Sequential fold operation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `list` is a regular `List`, and the `fold` operation is performed sequentially, as `List` does not support parallel operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing Between Parallelizable and Non-Parallelizable Collections\n",
    "The choice between parallelizable and non-parallelizable collections depends on the specific requirements of your application. If you need to perform operations that can be parallelized and want to take advantage of multi-core processors, parallelizable collections are suitable. However, if your operations are inherently sequential or the overhead of parallelization outweighs the benefits, non-parallelizable collections may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Sequential traits and generic collection traits** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sequential Traits**:\n",
    "   - Sequential traits are traits that define sequences of elements in a specific order.\n",
    "   - Examples of sequential traits in Scala's collection framework include `Seq`, `LinearSeq`, and `IndexedSeq`.\n",
    "   - `Seq`: The `Seq` trait represents a sequence of elements with a defined order. It is the base trait for all sequences in Scala, such as `List`, `Vector`, and `Queue`.\n",
    "   - `LinearSeq`: The `LinearSeq` trait represents a sequence of elements that can be efficiently traversed in a linear fashion. It is implemented by `List` and `Queue`.\n",
    "   - `IndexedSeq`: The `IndexedSeq` trait represents a sequence of elements that can be efficiently accessed by index. It is implemented by `Vector` and `Array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generic Collection Traits**:\n",
    "   - Generic collection traits are traits that define collections parameterized by the type of elements they contain.\n",
    "   - Examples of generic collection traits in Scala's collection framework include `Iterable`, `Seq`, `Set`, and `Map`.\n",
    "   - `Iterable`: The `Iterable` trait represents a collection that can be iterated over. It is the base trait for all collections in Scala.\n",
    "   - `Seq`, `Set`, `Map`: These traits extend `Iterable` and provide additional operations specific to sequences, sets, and maps, respectively.\n",
    "   - Using generic collection traits allows you to write code that is generic over different types of collections, making your code more flexible and reusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "// Define a generic function that takes any sequence and prints its elements\n",
    "def printElements[T](seq: Seq[T]): Unit = {\n",
    "  seq.foreach(println)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Use the function with different types of sequences\n",
    "val list = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val vector = Vector('a', 'b', 'c')\n",
    "val set = Set(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "\n",
    "printElements(list)\n",
    "printElements(vector)\n",
    "printElements(set)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Traversable Collections**\n",
    "`Traversable` is a trait in Scala that represents iterable collections that can be traversed sequentially. It provides a set of operations for iterating over elements, transforming elements, filtering elements, and aggregating elements. The `Traversable` trait does not define any specific ordering for its elements and is more focused on providing a uniform way to access and process elements in a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed explanation of `Traversable` operations with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **foreach**: The `foreach` method applies a function to each element in the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "   numbers.foreach(println)\n",
    "   // Output:\n",
    "   // 1\n",
    "   // 2\n",
    "   // 3\n",
    "   // 4\n",
    "   // 5\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **map**: The `map` method transforms each element of the collection using a given function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val squares = numbers.map(x => x * x)\n",
    "   println(squares)\n",
    "   // Output: List(1, 4, 9, 16, 25)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **flatMap**: The `flatMap` method is similar to `map` but flattens the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val flatMapped = numbers.flatMap(x => List(x, x * 10))\n",
    "   println(flatMapped)\n",
    "   // Output: List(1, 10, 2, 20, 3, 30, 4, 40, 5, 50)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **filter**: The `filter` method selects elements that satisfy a predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val evenNumbers = numbers.filter(_ % 2 == 0)\n",
    "   println(evenNumbers)\n",
    "   // Output: List(2, 4)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **foldLeft**: The `foldLeft` method aggregates the elements of the collection using a binary operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val sum = numbers.foldLeft(0)(_ + _)\n",
    "   println(sum)\n",
    "   // Output: 15\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **reduceLeft**: The `reduceLeft` method combines the elements of the collection using a binary operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val max = numbers.reduceLeft((x, y) => if (x > y) x else y)\n",
    "   println(max)\n",
    "   // Output: 5\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **exists**: The `exists` method checks if any element in the collection satisfies a predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val hasNegative = numbers.exists(_ < 0)\n",
    "   println(hasNegative)\n",
    "   // Output: false\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **forall**: The `forall` method checks if all elements in the collection satisfy a predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val allPositive = numbers.forall(_ > 0)\n",
    "   println(allPositive)\n",
    "   // Output: true\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **groupBy**: The `groupBy` method groups elements of the collection by a key generated by a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val words = List(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\", \"pear\")\n",
    "   val groupedByLength = words.groupBy(_.length)\n",
    "   println(groupedByLength)\n",
    "   // Output: Map(5 -> List(apple, banana, orange), 4 -> List(pear))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Iterable Collections**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Iterable` is a trait in Scala that represents collections that can be iterated over. It provides a way to access elements sequentially without specifying an ordering. `Iterable` extends the `Traversable` trait and adds methods for creating iterators and checking if the collection is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed explanation of `Iterable` with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterator**: The `iterator` method returns an iterator over the elements of the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "   val iter = numbers.iterator\n",
    "   println(iter.next()) // Output: 1\n",
    "   println(iter.next()) // Output: 2\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **isEmpty**: The `isEmpty` method returns `true` if the collection is empty, `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   println(numbers.isEmpty) // Output: false\n",
    "   println(List.empty.isEmpty) // Output: true\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **nonEmpty**: The `nonEmpty` method returns `true` if the collection is not empty, `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   println(numbers.nonEmpty) // Output: true\n",
    "   println(List.empty.nonEmpty) // Output: false\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **head**: The `head` method returns the first element of the collection. It throws an exception if the collection is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   println(numbers.head) // Output: 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **headOption**: The `headOption` method returns an `Option` containing the first element of the collection if it exists, `None` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   println(numbers.headOption) // Output: Some(1)\n",
    "   println(List.empty.headOption) // Output: None\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **tail**: The `tail` method returns a new collection containing all elements except the first one. It throws an exception if the collection is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   println(numbers.tail) // Output: List(2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **iterator Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val animals = Iterable(\"cat\", \"dog\", \"rabbit\")\n",
    "   val animalIterator = animals.iterator\n",
    "   while (animalIterator.hasNext) {\n",
    "     println(animalIterator.next())\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **isEmpty Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val emptyIterable = Iterable.empty\n",
    "   println(emptyIterable.isEmpty) // Output: true\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **headOption Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val fruits = Iterable(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"orange\")\n",
    "   val firstFruit = fruits.headOption.getOrElse(\"No fruit\")\n",
    "   println(firstFruit) // Output: apple\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **`Seq[T]`, `Set[T]`, and `Map[K, V]`**\n",
    "`Seq[T]`, `Set[T]`, and `Map[K, V]` are commonly used collection types in Scala, each serving a specific purpose and offering different capabilities. Here's a detailed explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Seq[T]**: `Seq` is a trait in Scala that represents sequences of elements. Sequences maintain the order of elements and allow duplicates. There are several concrete implementations of `Seq`, such as `List`, `Vector`, and `Queue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **List**: A `List` is an ordered collection of elements. It is implemented as a linked list and provides fast access to the head but slower access to elements in the middle.\n",
    "   - **Vector**: A `Vector` is an indexed sequence that provides fast access to elements at any position. It is implemented as a tree structure and offers efficient random access and updates.\n",
    "   - **Queue**: A `Queue` is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure that allows adding elements to the end (enqueue) and removing elements from the front (dequeue) efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val list = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "   val vector = Vector(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "   val queue = Queue(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set[T]**: `Set` is a trait in Scala that represents a collection of unique elements. Sets do not maintain any order for the elements. There are several concrete implementations of `Set`, such as `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, and `LinkedHashSet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **HashSet**: A `HashSet` is a set implementation based on a hash table. It provides constant-time complexity for adding, removing, and checking for the presence of elements.\n",
    "   - **TreeSet**: A `TreeSet` is a set implementation based on a binary search tree. It maintains elements in sorted order and provides logarithmic-time complexity for adding, removing, and checking for the presence of elements.\n",
    "   - **LinkedHashSet**: A `LinkedHashSet` is a set implementation that maintains the insertion order of elements. It provides constant-time complexity for adding, removing, and checking for the presence of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val hashSet = HashSet(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "   val treeSet = TreeSet(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "   val linkedHashSet = LinkedHashSet(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Map[K, V]**: `Map` is a trait in Scala that represents a collection of key-value pairs. Each key in a map is unique, and the keys are used to access their corresponding values. There are several concrete implementations of `Map`, such as `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, and `LinkedHashMap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **HashMap**: A `HashMap` is a map implementation based on a hash table. It provides constant-time complexity for adding, removing, and accessing elements based on their keys.\n",
    "   - **TreeMap**: A `TreeMap` is a map implementation based on a binary search tree. It maintains key-value pairs in sorted order based on the keys and provides logarithmic-time complexity for adding, removing, and accessing elements.\n",
    "   - **LinkedHashMap**: A `LinkedHashMap` is a map implementation that maintains the insertion order of key-value pairs. It provides constant-time complexity for adding, removing, and accessing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val hashMap = HashMap(\"a\" -> 1, \"b\" -> 2, \"c\" -> 3)\n",
    "   val treeMap = TreeMap(\"a\" -> 1, \"b\" -> 2, \"c\" -> 3)\n",
    "   val linkedHashMap = LinkedHashMap(\"a\" -> 1, \"b\" -> 2, \"c\" -> 3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **TreeMap colelction**\n",
    "The `TreeMap` collection in Scala is a type of map that maintains its elements in a sorted order based on their keys. Unlike `HashMap`, which does not guarantee any particular order, `TreeMap` ensures that its elements are always sorted according to the natural ordering of the keys or a custom ordering provided by an implicit `Ordering`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an overview of `TreeMap` in Scala:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sorted Order**: `TreeMap` maintains its elements in a sorted order based on the keys. This allows for efficient operations like range queries and finding the nearest neighbors of a given key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Ordering**: You can provide a custom ordering for the keys by passing an implicit `Ordering` instance to the `apply` method of the `TreeMap` companion object. This allows you to define the ordering based on your specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutability**: Like other collections in Scala, `TreeMap` is immutable by default. This means that operations on a `TreeMap` return a new `TreeMap` instance with the updated elements, leaving the original `TreeMap` unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance**: The performance of operations on `TreeMap` is generally logarithmic in the size of the map, making it suitable for large collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of using `TreeMap` in Scala:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "import scala.collection.immutable.TreeMap\n",
    "\n",
    "// Create a TreeMap with custom ordering\n",
    "implicit val customOrdering: Ordering[Int] = Ordering.Int.reverse\n",
    "val treeMap = TreeMap(3 -> \"three\", 1 -> \"one\", 2 -> \"two\")\n",
    "\n",
    "// Print the elements of the TreeMap in sorted order\n",
    "treeMap.foreach { case (key, value) =>\n",
    "  println(s\"Key: $key, Value: $value\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "//we create a `TreeMap` with a custom ordering for `Int` keys in reverse order. The elements are then printed in sorted order based on the custom ordering.\n",
