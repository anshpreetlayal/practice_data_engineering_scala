    "### Data Parallel Abstractions\n",
    "\n",
    "Data parallelism is a programming paradigm where operations are applied to multiple elements of a data collection concurrently. In Scala, data parallelism is supported by various abstractions that help manage parallel computations efficiently. These abstractions include iterators, splitters, builders, and combiners.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iterators\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Iterators in Scala are used to traverse collections sequentially. They provide methods like `next()` to retrieve the next element and `hasNext()` to check if there are more elements.\n",
    "- **Parallelism**: While iterators themselves are not parallel, they can be used to create parallel collections that support parallel operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Splitters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Splitters are used to divide a collection into smaller chunks for parallel processing. They provide methods like `splitAt(index: Int)` to split the collection at a given index and `remaining` to get the remaining elements after splitting.\n",
    "- **Parallelism**: Splitters enable efficient partitioning of collections for parallel operations, improving parallelism and load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Builders\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Builders are used to construct new collections. They provide methods like `+=` to add elements to the collection and `result` to get the final collection.\n",
    "- **Parallelism**: Builders can be used in parallel operations to construct new collections concurrently, combining results from different parallel tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combiners\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Combiners are used to combine the results of parallel operations on collections. They provide methods like `combine()` to merge partial results.\n",
    "- **Parallelism**: Combiners facilitate the efficient merging of results from parallel computations, reducing overhead and ensuring correctness.\n",
