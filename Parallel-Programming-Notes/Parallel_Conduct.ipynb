    "## **`First-class Tasks`**\n",
    "First-class tasks in concurrent programming refer to treating tasks or computations as first-class citizens, meaning they can be manipulated and passed around like any other data type. This concept is fundamental in functional programming and concurrent programming paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Scala or any language that supports functional programming and concurrency, first-class tasks typically involve the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: Tasks are encapsulated as values that can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to functions, and returned as results from functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction**: Tasks are abstracted away from specific execution details, allowing developers to focus on what needs to be done rather than how it's done. This promotes modularity and separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Composition**: Tasks can be composed together to form more complex computations. This can be achieved through various combinators or higher-order functions that operate on tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Concurrency**: Tasks can execute concurrently or in parallel, depending on the underlying execution model. Concurrency primitives such as futures, promises, and asynchronous computations enable developers to express concurrent behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, first-class tasks are often represented using constructs like `Future`, which represents a computation that will complete at some point in the future, and `Promise`, which allows the production of values for asynchronous computations. Libraries like Akka provide actors as a higher-level abstraction for concurrent and distributed programming, where actors communicate through message passing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example demonstrating first-class tasks using Scala's `Future`:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global\n",
    "import scala.concurrent.Future\n",
    "\n",
    "// Define a task\n",
    "val task: Future[Int] = Future {\n",
    "  // Simulate a time-consuming computation\n",
    "  Thread.sleep(1000)\n",
    "  42\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Perform some other computations while waiting for the task to complete\n",
    "val result: Future[Int] = task.map(_ * 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "// Wait for the result and print it\n",
    "result.foreach(println)\n",
    "// `task` represents a computation that will produce the value `42` after a delay of one second. We then use `map` to transform the result of the task and double it. Finally, we print the result when it becomes available. This demonstrates the encapsulation, abstraction, and composition aspects of first-class tasks in Scala.\n",
