    "### Classes and Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classes**:\n",
    "- Classes in Scala are blueprint for creating objects.\n",
    "- They can have fields (variables) and methods.\n",
    "- Example of a class:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  class Person(name: String, age: Int) {\n",
    "    def greet(): Unit = {\n",
    "      println(s\"Hello, my name is $name and I'm $age years old.\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objects**:\n",
    "- Objects are single instances of their own definitions.\n",
    "- They are commonly used for singleton patterns or to hold utility methods.\n",
    "- Example of an object:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  object MathUtils {\n",
    "    def square(x: Int): Int = x * x\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constructors**:\n",
    "- Primary constructors are declared in the class signature.\n",
    "- Auxiliary constructors are defined using `def this(...)`.\n",
    "- Example of a class with primary constructor:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  class Person(val name: String, var age: Int) {\n",
    "    def this(name: String) = this(name, 0) // Auxiliary constructor\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traits and Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traits**:\n",
    "- Traits are similar to interfaces in other languages but can also include concrete methods.\n",
    "- They are used for code reuse and to achieve multiple inheritances.\n",
    "- Example of a trait:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  trait Speaker {\n",
    "    def speak(): Unit\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance**:\n",
    "- Classes can inherit from one superclass but can mix in multiple traits.\n",
    "- Subclasses can override methods and fields from superclasses or traits.\n",
    "- Example of inheritance:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  class Dog(name: String) extends Animal(name) with Speaker {\n",
    "    override def speak(): Unit = {\n",
    "      println(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Companion Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose**:\n",
    "- Companion objects are used to define static methods and fields related to a class.\n",
    "- They have the same name as the class and can access private members of the class.\n",
    "- Example of a companion object:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  object Person {\n",
    "    def apply(name: String, age: Int): Person = new Person(name, age)\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage**:\n",
    "- Companion objects are often used to create instances of the corresponding class without using the `new` keyword.\n",
    "- They can also hold factory methods or other static functionality related to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism in Scala:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subtyping Polymorphism**:\n",
    "- Subtyping polymorphism allows a subclass to be treated as an instance of its superclass.\n",
    "- In Scala, this is achieved through class inheritance and trait implementation.\n",
    "- Example of subtyping polymorphism:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  class Animal {\n",
    "    def makeSound(): Unit = println(\"Some sound\")\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  class Dog extends Animal {\n",
    "    override def makeSound(): Unit = println(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  val animal: Animal = new Dog()\n",
    "  animal.makeSound() // Outputs \"Woof!\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parametric Polymorphism**:\n",
    "- Parametric polymorphism allows a function or a data type to handle values uniformly without knowing their specific type.\n",
    "- In Scala, this is achieved using generics.\n",
    "- Example of parametric polymorphism:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  def identity[A](a: A): A = a\n",
    "\n",
    "  val result: Int = identity[Int](5) // result = 5\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type Bounds and Variance**:\n",
    "- Scala allows you to specify type bounds and variance to control polymorphic behavior.\n",
    "- Type bounds restrict the types that can be used in a generic context.\n",
    "- Variance (covariance, contravariance, invariance) specifies how subtyping relationships between generic types transfer to the container types.\n",
    "- Example of type bounds and variance:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  class Container[+A](val elem: A) // Covariant container\n",
    "\n",
    "  def printAnimalName(container: Container[Animal]): Unit = println(container.elem.getClass.getSimpleName)\n",
    "\n",
    "  val dogContainer: Container[Dog] = new Container[Dog](new Dog())\n",
    "  printAnimalName(dogContainer) // Outputs \"Dog\"\n",
    "  ```"
