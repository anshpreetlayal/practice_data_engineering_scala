    "## **The Observer Pattern**\n",
    "The Observer Pattern, often utilized in imperative event handling, is a design pattern that facilitates communication between objects by defining a one-to-many dependency between them. In this pattern, when the state of one object (the subject) changes, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This enables loose coupling between the subject and its observers, allowing for better maintainability and extensibility of the codebase.\n",

    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Key Components:**\n",
    "   - **Subject:** The object being observed. It maintains a list of observers and notifies them of any state changes.\n",
    "   - **Observer:** The objects interested in the state changes of the subject. They register themselves with the subject and are notified when changes occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Workflow:**\n",
    "   - The subject maintains a collection of observers and provides methods to register, unregister, and notify observers.\n",
    "   - Observers register themselves with the subject to receive updates.\n",
    "   - When the subject's state changes, it notifies all registered observers by invoking a specific method on each observer.\n",
    "   - Observers then react to the notification by performing necessary actions based on the updated state of the subject.\n",
