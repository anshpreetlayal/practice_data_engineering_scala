    "\n",
    "1. **What is a Monad?**\n",
    "   - A monad is a design pattern in functional programming that represents a computation or a sequence of steps. It provides a way to chain operations together, handling side effects and error handling in a predictable manner.\n",
    "   - In Scala, monads are implemented as types that adhere to the monadic laws and provide operations like `flatMap` and `map`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monad Laws:**\n",
    "   - **Left Identity:** `unit(x).flatMap(f)` is equivalent to `f(x)`.\n",
    "   - **Right Identity:** `m.flatMap(unit)` is equivalent to `m`.\n",
    "   - **Associativity:** `m.flatMap(f).flatMap(g)` is equivalent to `m.flatMap(x => f(x).flatMap(g))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Common Monad Operations:**\n",
    "   - `flatMap`: Used to chain operations together, taking a function that returns another monad.\n",
    "   - `map`: Similar to `flatMap`, but the function returns a non-monadic value.\n",
    "   - `unit` (or `pure`): Wraps a value into a monad, often called `return` in other languages.\n",
    "   - `getOrElse`: Extracts the value from the monad or provides a default value if the monad is empty.\n",
    "   - `filter`: Filters the monad based on a predicate.\n",
