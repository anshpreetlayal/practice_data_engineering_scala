    "###  **Immutable Linked Lists**\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable linked lists in Scala are implemented using the `List` class. Each element of the list is a node that contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. Immutable means that once a list is created, its elements cannot be changed; you can only create new lists by adding or removing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val list = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "println(list) // Output: List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "val newList = 0 :: list\n",
    "println(newList) // Output: List(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Con-lists (Type Parameters)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Con-lists, or constructed lists, refer to lists that are created by adding elements to an existing list. In Scala, lists are immutable, so adding an element to a list creates a new list with the added element. Type parameters allow you to create lists of a specific type, ensuring type safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val list: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val newList = 0 :: list\n",
    "println(newList) // Output: List(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `List[Int]` specifies that `list` is a list of integers. The `::` operator is used to add an element to the beginning of the list, creating a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lists in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, lists are immutable collections that can hold elements of the same type. They are widely used due to their versatility and the rich set of operations they support.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Constructors of Lists`\n",
    "Lists can be constructed using the `List` class or the `::` (cons) operator. The `List` class has two main constructors: `Nil` for an empty list and `::` for constructing a list by prepending an element to an existing list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val emptyList = Nil\n",
    "val list = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Right Associativity`\n",
    "The `::` operator is right-associative, which means it groups elements to the right. This allows for concise list construction syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val list = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil\n",
    "// Equivalent to: Nil.::(3).::(2).::(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `List Operations`\n",
    "Scala lists support various operations such as `head` (to get the first element), `tail` (to get the rest of the list), `isEmpty` (to check if the list is empty), `length` (to get the length of the list), and `reverse` (to reverse the list).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val list = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "println(list.head) // Output: 1\n",
    "println(list.tail) // Output: List(2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "println(list.isEmpty) // Output: false\n",
    "println(list.length) // Output: 5\n",
    "println(list.reverse) // Output: List(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `List Pattern Matching`\n",
    "Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Scala that can be used with lists. It allows you to destructure lists and match on their elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val list = List(1, 2, 3)\n",
    "list match {\n",
    "  case Nil => println(\"Empty list\")\n",
    "  case head :: tail => println(s\"Head: $head, Tail: $tail\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output: Head: 1, Tail: List(2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Higher-Order List Functions in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. In Scala, higher-order functions are commonly used with lists to perform operations like mapping and filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Mapping`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `map` function applies a given function to each element of a list, returning a new list with the transformed elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val doubled = numbers.map(_ * 2)\n",
    "println(doubled) // Output: List(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `_ * 2` function is applied to each element of the `numbers` list, doubling each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Filtering`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `filter` function returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy a given predicate (a function that returns a boolean value).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val evens = numbers.filter(_ % 2 == 0)\n",
    "println(evens) // Output: List(2, 4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the predicate `_ % 2 == 0` filters out all odd numbers from the `numbers` list, leaving only the even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `map` and `filter` are higher-order functions because they take another function (`_ * 2` and `_ % 2 == 0`, respectively) as an argument. These functions are powerful tools for working with lists in a functional and expressive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reduction of Lists in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduction functions in Scala are used to combine the elements of a list into a single result. There are several reduction functions available, including `reduceLeft`, `reduceRight`, `foldLeft`, and `foldRight`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `reduceLeft`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `reduceLeft` function combines elements from left to right using a binary operation. It starts with the first element of the list as the initial value and applies the operation sequentially to each element and the result of the previous operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val sum = numbers.reduceLeft(_ + _)\n",
    "println(sum) // Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `reduceRight`\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to `reduceLeft`, `reduceRight` combines elements from right to left using a binary operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val sum = numbers.reduceRight(_ + _)\n",
    "println(sum) // Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `foldLeft`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `foldLeft` function is similar to `reduceLeft` but takes an additional initial value. It combines elements from left to right using a binary operation, starting with the initial value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val sum = numbers.foldLeft(0)(_ + _)\n",
    "println(sum) // Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `foldRight`\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to `foldLeft`, `foldRight` combines elements from right to left using a binary operation and an initial value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val sum = numbers.foldRight(0)(_ + _)\n",
    "println(sum) // Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reasoning with Lists in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with lists in Scala, it's important to understand certain principles and techniques for reasoning about lists effectively. This includes understanding the laws of concat, natural induction, and structural induction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Laws of Concat`\n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenation of lists should satisfy certain laws to ensure consistency and predictability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Associativity**: Concatenating three lists should yield the same result regardless of how the concatenations are grouped.\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val xs = List(1, 2)\n",
    "   val ys = List(3, 4)\n",
    "   val zs = List(5, 6)\n",
    "   assert((xs ++ ys) ++ zs == xs ++ (ys ++ zs))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identity**: Concatenating a list with an empty list should yield the original list.\n",
    "   ```scala\n",
    "   val xs = List(1, 2)\n",
    "   assert(xs ++ Nil == xs && Nil ++ xs == xs)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Natural Induction`\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural induction is a method of proving properties of lists by first proving the property for the base case (e.g., an empty list) and then proving that if the property holds for a list of size `n`, it also holds for a list of size `n+1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (proving the sum of a list):\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def sum(xs: List[Int]): Int = xs match {\n",
    "  case Nil => 0\n",
    "  case head :: tail => head + sum(tail)\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Base case: sum of Nil is 0\n",
    "assert(sum(Nil) == 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "// Inductive step: if sum holds for a list, it also holds for a list with an additional element\n",
    "val xs = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "assert(sum(xs) == xs.sum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Structural Induction`\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural induction is similar to natural induction but applies to the structure of a data type. For lists, it involves proving that if a property holds for an empty list and holds for the tail of a list, it also holds for the full list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (proving the length of a list):\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def length(xs: List[Any]): Int = xs match {\n",
    "  case Nil => 0\n",
    "  case _ :: tail => 1 + length(tail)\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Base case: length of Nil is 0\n",
    "assert(length(Nil) == 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "// Inductive step: if length holds for the tail of a list, it also holds for the full list\n",
    "val xs = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "assert(length(xs) == xs.length)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Primary Constructors and Auxiliary Constructors in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, classes can have one primary constructor and zero or more auxiliary constructors. The primary constructor is defined as part of the class declaration, while auxiliary constructors are defined using the `def this(...)` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Primary Constructor`\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary constructor is defined within the class declaration itself. It can take parameters, and those parameters can be used to initialize class fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "class Person(name: String, age: Int) {\n",
    "  println(s\"Creating a person named $name aged $age\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `name` and `age` are parameters of the primary constructor, and they are used to initialize the `name` and `age` fields of the `Person` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Auxiliary Constructors`\n",
    "\n",
    "Auxiliary constructors are additional constructors that can be defined in a class. They are defined using the `def this(...)` syntax and must call either the primary constructor or another auxiliary constructor as their first statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "class Person(name: String, age: Int) {\n",
    "  def this(name: String) {\n",
    "    this(name, 0) // Calls the primary constructor with default age 0\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  def this() {\n",
    "    this(\"John Doe\") // Calls the auxiliary constructor with default name \"John Doe\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  println(s\"Creating a person named $name aged $age\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we have two auxiliary constructors. The first one takes only a `name` parameter and calls the primary constructor with the provided `name` and a default age of 0. The second auxiliary constructor calls the first auxiliary constructor with a default name of \"John Doe\".\n",
