    "###  **Immutable Linked Lists**\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable linked lists in Scala are implemented using the `List` class. Each element of the list is a node that contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. Immutable means that once a list is created, its elements cannot be changed; you can only create new lists by adding or removing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val list = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "println(list) // Output: List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "val newList = 0 :: list\n",
    "println(newList) // Output: List(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###  **Con-lists (Type Parameters)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Con-lists, or constructed lists, refer to lists that are created by adding elements to an existing list. In Scala, lists are immutable, so adding an element to a list creates a new list with the added element. Type parameters allow you to create lists of a specific type, ensuring type safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val list: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val newList = 0 :: list\n",
    "println(newList) // Output: List(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `List[Int]` specifies that `list` is a list of integers. The `::` operator is used to add an element to the beginning of the list, creating a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lists in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, lists are immutable collections that can hold elements of the same type. They are widely used due to their versatility and the rich set of operations they support.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Constructors of Lists`\n",
    "Lists can be constructed using the `List` class or the `::` (cons) operator. The `List` class has two main constructors: `Nil` for an empty list and `::` for constructing a list by prepending an element to an existing list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val emptyList = Nil\n",
    "val list = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Right Associativity`\n",
    "The `::` operator is right-associative, which means it groups elements to the right. This allows for concise list construction syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val list = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil\n",
    "// Equivalent to: Nil.::(3).::(2).::(1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `List Operations`\n",
    "Scala lists support various operations such as `head` (to get the first element), `tail` (to get the rest of the list), `isEmpty` (to check if the list is empty), `length` (to get the length of the list), and `reverse` (to reverse the list).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val list = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "println(list.head) // Output: 1\n",
    "println(list.tail) // Output: List(2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "println(list.isEmpty) // Output: false\n",
    "println(list.length) // Output: 5\n",
    "println(list.reverse) // Output: List(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `List Pattern Matching`\n",
    "Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Scala that can be used with lists. It allows you to destructure lists and match on their elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val list = List(1, 2, 3)\n",
    "list match {\n",
    "  case Nil => println(\"Empty list\")\n",
    "  case head :: tail => println(s\"Head: $head, Tail: $tail\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output: Head: 1, Tail: List(2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Higher-Order List Functions in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. In Scala, higher-order functions are commonly used with lists to perform operations like mapping and filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Mapping`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `map` function applies a given function to each element of a list, returning a new list with the transformed elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val doubled = numbers.map(_ * 2)\n",
    "println(doubled) // Output: List(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `_ * 2` function is applied to each element of the `numbers` list, doubling each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Filtering`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `filter` function returns a new list containing only the elements that satisfy a given predicate (a function that returns a boolean value).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val evens = numbers.filter(_ % 2 == 0)\n",
    "println(evens) // Output: List(2, 4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the predicate `_ % 2 == 0` filters out all odd numbers from the `numbers` list, leaving only the even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `map` and `filter` are higher-order functions because they take another function (`_ * 2` and `_ % 2 == 0`, respectively) as an argument. These functions are powerful tools for working with lists in a functional and expressive way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reduction of Lists in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduction functions in Scala are used to combine the elements of a list into a single result. There are several reduction functions available, including `reduceLeft`, `reduceRight`, `foldLeft`, and `foldRight`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `reduceLeft`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `reduceLeft` function combines elements from left to right using a binary operation. It starts with the first element of the list as the initial value and applies the operation sequentially to each element and the result of the previous operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val sum = numbers.reduceLeft(_ + _)\n",
    "println(sum) // Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `reduceRight`\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to `reduceLeft`, `reduceRight` combines elements from right to left using a binary operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val sum = numbers.reduceRight(_ + _)\n",
    "println(sum) // Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `foldLeft`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `foldLeft` function is similar to `reduceLeft` but takes an additional initial value. It combines elements from left to right using a binary operation, starting with the initial value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val sum = numbers.foldLeft(0)(_ + _)\n",
    "println(sum) // Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `foldRight`\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to `foldLeft`, `foldRight` combines elements from right to left using a binary operation and an initial value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val sum = numbers.foldRight(0)(_ + _)\n",
    "println(sum) // Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
