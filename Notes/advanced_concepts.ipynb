    "### **Reduce Expressions Using the Substitution Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "The substitution model is a way to evaluate expressions in programming languages by substituting arguments into function bodies. Reducing expressions using the substitution model involves repeatedly applying this substitution process until a final value is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Addition of Two Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "// Original expression: 1 + 2\n",
    "val result = 1 + 2\n",
    "println(result) // Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start with the expression `1 + 2`.\n",
    "2. Substitute `1` for the first operand and `2` for the second operand.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the expression to get the result `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Nested Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "// Original expression: (1 + 2) * 3\n",
    "val result = (1 + 2) * 3\n",
    "println(result) // Output: 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start with the expression `(1 + 2) * 3`.\n",
    "2. Substitute `1 + 2` for the inner parentheses, yielding `3 * 3`.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the expression to get the result `9`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Function Application\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "// Original expression: add(1, 2)\n",
    "def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b\n",
    "val result = add(1, 2)\n",
    "println(result) // Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start with the expression `add(1, 2)`.\n",
    "2. Substitute `1` for `a` and `2` for `b` in the function body, yielding `1 + 2`.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the expression to get the result `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Preconditions Using `require`**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, `require` is a method that checks a condition and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the condition is not met. It is often used to enforce preconditions in functions, ensuring that certain conditions are true before proceeding with the rest of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {\n",
    "  require(b != 0, \"Denominator must be non-zero\")\n",
    "  a / b\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "val result = divide(10, 2) // OK\n",
    "val result2 = divide(10, 0) // IllegalArgumentException: Denominator must be non-zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `require` statement ensures that the denominator (`b`) is not zero before performing the division operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Assertion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions in Scala are used to check conditions that should always be true during development and testing. They are typically used to catch bugs early and ensure that certain invariants are maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def factorial(n: Int): Int = {\n",
    "  assert(n >= 0, \"Factorial input must be non-negative\")\n",
    "  if (n == 0) 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "val result = factorial(5) // OK\n",
    "val result2 = factorial(-1) // AssertionError: assertion failed: Factorial input must be non-negative\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `assert` statement checks that the input to the `factorial` function is non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `require` and `assert` are useful for ensuring that certain conditions are met in our code, helping to catch errors and maintain correctness. However, it's important to note that `assert` statements are typically disabled in production code for performance reasons, so they should be used primarily for debugging and testing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Referential Transparency in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "Referential transparency is a property of expressions in a programming language. An expression is said to be referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its value without changing the program's behavior. This property allows for easier reasoning about code and facilitates optimizations by the compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Referentially Transparent Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, pure functions (functions without side effects) and immutable data structures often lead to referentially transparent code. Consider the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `add` function is referentially transparent because it always returns the same result for the same input, and calling it with the same arguments can be replaced with its result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Non-Referentially Transparent Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, expressions involving mutable state or side effects are not referentially transparent. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "var total = 0\n",
    "def addToTotal(x: Int): Int = {\n",
    "  total += x\n",
    "  total\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `addToTotal` function is not referentially transparent because calling it with the same argument multiple times can yield different results, depending on the current value of `total`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Benefits of Referential Transparency`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reasoning**: Referentially transparent code is easier to reason about because you can understand the behavior of an expression by looking at its value, without considering its context or state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing**: Referentially transparent code is easier to test because you can test individual functions in isolation without needing to set up complex state or dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimization**: Referentially transparent expressions can be optimized by the compiler or runtime, such as memoization or common subexpression elimination, without changing the program's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Packages in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages in Scala are used to organize classes, objects, and traits into namespaces. They help in avoiding naming conflicts and make it easier to manage large codebases. Here's how you can define and use packages in Scala:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Defining a Package`\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a package, use the `package` keyword followed by the package name at the beginning of your Scala source file. For example, to define a package named `com.example`, you would write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "package com.example\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyClass {\n",
    "  // Class definition\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Using a Package`\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a class, object, or trait from a package, you need to import it. You can import specific members of a package or the entire package. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "package com.example\n",
    "\n",
    "object Main {\n",
    "  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n",
    "    val myClass = new MyClass\n",
    "    println(myClass)\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Subpackages`\n",
    "\n",
    "Scala allows you to define subpackages by using dots (`.`) in the package name. For example, you can define a subpackage `models` inside the `com.example` package like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "package com.example.models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Model {\n",
    "  // Class definition\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Subtyping and Generics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtyping and generics are powerful features in Scala that allow you to write flexible and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Subtyping**: Subtyping allows a subtype to be substituted for its supertype. For example, if `Dog` is a subtype of `Animal`, you can pass a `Dog` object wherever an `Animal` object is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generics**: Generics allow you to define classes, traits, and functions that can work with different types. For example, you can define a generic `List` class that can hold elements of any type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of subtyping and generics:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "trait Animal {\n",
    "  def speak(): Unit\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog extends Animal {\n",
    "  override def speak(): Unit = println(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat extends Animal {\n",
    "  override def speak(): Unit = println(\"Meow!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class AnimalList[A <: Animal](val animals: List[A]) {\n",
    "  def makeAllSpeak(): Unit = {\n",
    "    animals.foreach(_.speak())\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val animals = List(new Dog, new Cat)\n",
    "val animalList = new AnimalList(animals)\n",
    "animalList.makeAllSpeak()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above example, `Dog` and `Cat` are subtypes of `Animal`, and the `AnimalList` class uses a generic type `A` that must be a subtype of `Animal`. This allows `AnimalList` to work with any type of `Animal`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Bounds (Type Bounds) in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bounds in Scala are used to restrict the type that can be used as a type parameter. There are two types of bounds: upper bounds and lower bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Upper Bounds`\n",
    "\n",
    "An upper bound restricts the type to be a subtype of a given type. It is denoted by `<:`. For example, `T <: Comparable[T]` means that `T` must be a subtype of `Comparable[T]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "class Container[T <: Comparable[T]](val value: T) {\n",
    "  def compare(other: T): Boolean = value.compareTo(other) == 0\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `T` is restricted to be a subtype of `Comparable[T]`, ensuring that the `compare` method can be called on the `value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Lower Bounds`\n",
    "\n",
    "A lower bound restricts the type to be a supertype of a given type. It is denoted by `>:`. For example, `T >: Number` means that `T` must be a supertype of `Number`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "class Container[T >: Int](val value: T) {\n",
    "  def printValue(): Unit = println(value)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `T` is restricted to be a supertype of `Int`, allowing `T` to be `AnyVal` or `Any`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Variance (Covariance) in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is a way to specify how subtyping relationships between complex types relate to subtyping relationships between their components. In Scala, there are three variance annotations: `+` for covariance, `-` for contravariance, and no annotation for invariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Covariance (+)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance allows a type parameter to vary in the same direction as its containing type. It is denoted by `+`. For example, `List[+T]` is a covariant list, meaning that if `S` is a subtype of `T`, then `List[S]` is a subtype of `List[T]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "class CovariantContainer[+T](val value: T) {\n",
    "  def getValue: T = value\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val intContainer: CovariantContainer[Int] = new CovariantContainer(42)\n",
    "val numberContainer: CovariantContainer[Number] = intContainer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `CovariantContainer[Number]` is a supertype of `CovariantContainer[Int]` because `CovariantContainer` is covariant in its type parameter `T`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Contravariance (-)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Contravariance is the opposite of covariance. It allows a type parameter to vary in the opposite direction of its containing type. It is denoted by `-`. For example, `Function1[-T, +R]` is contravariant in `T` and covariant in `R`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "trait Comparator[-T] {\n",
    "  def compare(a: T, b: T): Int\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val numberComparator: Comparator[Number] = new Comparator[Number] {\n",
    "  override def compare(a: Number, b: Number): Int = a.intValue() - b.intValue()\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val integerComparator: Comparator[Int] = numberComparator\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, `Comparator[Int]` is a subtype of `Comparator[Number]` because `Comparator` is contravariant in its type parameter `T`.\n"
