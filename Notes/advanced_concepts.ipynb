    "### **Reduce Expressions Using the Substitution Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "The substitution model is a way to evaluate expressions in programming languages by substituting arguments into function bodies. Reducing expressions using the substitution model involves repeatedly applying this substitution process until a final value is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Addition of Two Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "// Original expression: 1 + 2\n",
    "val result = 1 + 2\n",
    "println(result) // Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start with the expression `1 + 2`.\n",
    "2. Substitute `1` for the first operand and `2` for the second operand.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the expression to get the result `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Nested Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "// Original expression: (1 + 2) * 3\n",
    "val result = (1 + 2) * 3\n",
    "println(result) // Output: 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start with the expression `(1 + 2) * 3`.\n",
    "2. Substitute `1 + 2` for the inner parentheses, yielding `3 * 3`.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the expression to get the result `9`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Function Application\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "// Original expression: add(1, 2)\n",
    "def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b\n",
    "val result = add(1, 2)\n",
    "println(result) // Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start with the expression `add(1, 2)`.\n",
    "2. Substitute `1` for `a` and `2` for `b` in the function body, yielding `1 + 2`.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the expression to get the result `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Preconditions Using `require`**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, `require` is a method that checks a condition and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the condition is not met. It is often used to enforce preconditions in functions, ensuring that certain conditions are true before proceeding with the rest of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {\n",
    "  require(b != 0, \"Denominator must be non-zero\")\n",
    "  a / b\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "val result = divide(10, 2) // OK\n",
    "val result2 = divide(10, 0) // IllegalArgumentException: Denominator must be non-zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `require` statement ensures that the denominator (`b`) is not zero before performing the division operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Assertion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions in Scala are used to check conditions that should always be true during development and testing. They are typically used to catch bugs early and ensure that certain invariants are maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def factorial(n: Int): Int = {\n",
    "  assert(n >= 0, \"Factorial input must be non-negative\")\n",
    "  if (n == 0) 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "val result = factorial(5) // OK\n",
    "val result2 = factorial(-1) // AssertionError: assertion failed: Factorial input must be non-negative\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `assert` statement checks that the input to the `factorial` function is non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `require` and `assert` are useful for ensuring that certain conditions are met in our code, helping to catch errors and maintain correctness. However, it's important to note that `assert` statements are typically disabled in production code for performance reasons, so they should be used primarily for debugging and testing purposes.\n"
