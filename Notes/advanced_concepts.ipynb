    "### **Reduce Expressions Using the Substitution Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "The substitution model is a way to evaluate expressions in programming languages by substituting arguments into function bodies. Reducing expressions using the substitution model involves repeatedly applying this substitution process until a final value is obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Addition of Two Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "// Original expression: 1 + 2\n",
    "val result = 1 + 2\n",
    "println(result) // Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start with the expression `1 + 2`.\n",
    "2. Substitute `1` for the first operand and `2` for the second operand.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the expression to get the result `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Nested Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "// Original expression: (1 + 2) * 3\n",
    "val result = (1 + 2) * 3\n",
    "println(result) // Output: 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start with the expression `(1 + 2) * 3`.\n",
    "2. Substitute `1 + 2` for the inner parentheses, yielding `3 * 3`.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the expression to get the result `9`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3: Function Application\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "// Original expression: add(1, 2)\n",
    "def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b\n",
    "val result = add(1, 2)\n",
    "println(result) // Output: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start with the expression `add(1, 2)`.\n",
    "2. Substitute `1` for `a` and `2` for `b` in the function body, yielding `1 + 2`.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the expression to get the result `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Preconditions Using `require`**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, `require` is a method that checks a condition and throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if the condition is not met. It is often used to enforce preconditions in functions, ensuring that certain conditions are true before proceeding with the rest of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = {\n",
    "  require(b != 0, \"Denominator must be non-zero\")\n",
    "  a / b\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "val result = divide(10, 2) // OK\n",
    "val result2 = divide(10, 0) // IllegalArgumentException: Denominator must be non-zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `require` statement ensures that the denominator (`b`) is not zero before performing the division operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Assertion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions in Scala are used to check conditions that should always be true during development and testing. They are typically used to catch bugs early and ensure that certain invariants are maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def factorial(n: Int): Int = {\n",
    "  assert(n >= 0, \"Factorial input must be non-negative\")\n",
    "  if (n == 0) 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "val result = factorial(5) // OK\n",
    "val result2 = factorial(-1) // AssertionError: assertion failed: Factorial input must be non-negative\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `assert` statement checks that the input to the `factorial` function is non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `require` and `assert` are useful for ensuring that certain conditions are met in our code, helping to catch errors and maintain correctness. However, it's important to note that `assert` statements are typically disabled in production code for performance reasons, so they should be used primarily for debugging and testing purposes.\n",

    "### **Referential Transparency in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "Referential transparency is a property of expressions in a programming language. An expression is said to be referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its value without changing the program's behavior. This property allows for easier reasoning about code and facilitates optimizations by the compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Referentially Transparent Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "In Scala, pure functions (functions without side effects) and immutable data structures often lead to referentially transparent code. Consider the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `add` function is referentially transparent because it always returns the same result for the same input, and calling it with the same arguments can be replaced with its result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: Non-Referentially Transparent Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, expressions involving mutable state or side effects are not referentially transparent. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "var total = 0\n",
    "def addToTotal(x: Int): Int = {\n",
    "  total += x\n",
    "  total\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `addToTotal` function is not referentially transparent because calling it with the same argument multiple times can yield different results, depending on the current value of `total`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `Benefits of Referential Transparency`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reasoning**: Referentially transparent code is easier to reason about because you can understand the behavior of an expression by looking at its value, without considering its context or state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing**: Referentially transparent code is easier to test because you can test individual functions in isolation without needing to set up complex state or dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimization**: Referentially transparent expressions can be optimized by the compiler or runtime, such as memoization or common subexpression elimination, without changing the program's behavior.\n",
