    "### Immutability and Pure Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immutability**:\n",
    "- Immutability is a core principle in functional programming that states once an object is created, its state cannot be changed.\n",
    "- In Scala, you can declare variables as `val` for immutable values and `var` for mutable ones. For example:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  val x = 5  // Immutable\n",
    "  var y = 10 // Mutable\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pure Functions**:\n",
    "- Pure functions are functions that, given the same inputs, always return the same output and have no side effects.\n",
    "- They rely only on their input parameters and not on any external state.\n",
    "- Pure functions are easier to test, reason about, and parallelize.\n",
    "- Example of a pure function:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Immutability and Pure Functions**:\n",
    "- **Safety**: Immutable data structures are thread-safe and reduce the risk of bugs related to shared mutable state.\n",
    "- **Reasoning**: Pure functions are easier to understand and reason about because they have no side effects.\n",
    "- **Concurrency**: Immutability simplifies concurrent programming by avoiding the need for locks or other synchronization mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher-Order Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "- Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.\n",
    "- They enable you to abstract over actions, making your code more concise and expressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Using `map` to apply a function to each element of a list:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "  val squaredNumbers = numbers.map(x => x * x)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- **Code Reuse**: Higher-order functions promote code reuse by allowing you to pass different functions to achieve different behaviors.\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: They enable you to abstract over control structures, making your code more declarative and easier to understand.\n",
    "- **Composition**: Higher-order functions can be composed to create complex behavior from simpler functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Matching:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "- Pattern matching is a feature in Scala that allows you to match a value against a pattern and, if the match succeeds, destructure the value.\n",
    "- It is similar to a `switch` statement in other languages but is more powerful and expressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax**:\n",
    "- Using `match` to pattern match against a value:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  val day = \"Monday\"\n",
    "  val typeOfDay = day match {\n",
    "    case \"Monday\" => \"Weekday\"\n",
    "    case \"Saturday\" | \"Sunday\" => \"Weekend\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- **Readability**: Pattern matching can make code more readable by expressing logic in a concise and declarative way.\n",
    "- **Exhaustiveness**: Scala's pattern matching ensures that all cases are covered, reducing the likelihood of bugs.\n",
    "- **Destructuring**: It allows you to extract values from complex data structures such as case classes and tuples easily.\n",
