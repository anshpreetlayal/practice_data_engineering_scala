    "### Immutability and Pure Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immutability**:\n",
    "- Immutability is a core principle in functional programming that states once an object is created, its state cannot be changed.\n",
    "- In Scala, you can declare variables as `val` for immutable values and `var` for mutable ones. For example:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  val x = 5  // Immutable\n",
    "  var y = 10 // Mutable\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pure Functions**:\n",
    "- Pure functions are functions that, given the same inputs, always return the same output and have no side effects.\n",
    "- They rely only on their input parameters and not on any external state.\n",
    "- Pure functions are easier to test, reason about, and parallelize.\n",
    "- Example of a pure function:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Immutability and Pure Functions**:\n",
    "- **Safety**: Immutable data structures are thread-safe and reduce the risk of bugs related to shared mutable state.\n",
    "- **Reasoning**: Pure functions are easier to understand and reason about because they have no side effects.\n",
    "- **Concurrency**: Immutability simplifies concurrent programming by avoiding the need for locks or other synchronization mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher-Order Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "- Higher-order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.\n",
    "- They enable you to abstract over actions, making your code more concise and expressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Using `map` to apply a function to each element of a list:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "  val squaredNumbers = numbers.map(x => x * x)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- **Code Reuse**: Higher-order functions promote code reuse by allowing you to pass different functions to achieve different behaviors.\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: They enable you to abstract over control structures, making your code more declarative and easier to understand.\n",
    "- **Composition**: Higher-order functions can be composed to create complex behavior from simpler functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Matching:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "- Pattern matching is a feature in Scala that allows you to match a value against a pattern and, if the match succeeds, destructure the value.\n",
    "- It is similar to a `switch` statement in other languages but is more powerful and expressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax**:\n",
    "- Using `match` to pattern match against a value:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  val day = \"Monday\"\n",
    "  val typeOfDay = day match {\n",
    "    case \"Monday\" => \"Weekday\"\n",
    "    case \"Saturday\" | \"Sunday\" => \"Weekend\"\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "- **Readability**: Pattern matching can make code more readable by expressing logic in a concise and declarative way.\n",
    "- **Exhaustiveness**: Scala's pattern matching ensures that all cases are covered, reducing the likelihood of bugs.\n",
    "- **Destructuring**: It allows you to extract values from complex data structures such as case classes and tuples easily.\n",

    "#### Arithmetic and Boolean Expressions\n",
    "- Scala supports standard arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.\n",
    "- Boolean expressions use `true` and `false`, along with `&&` (and), `||` (or), and `!` (not) for logical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val sum = 1 + 2 * 3\n",
    "val isEven = (4 % 2 == 0) && (5 % 2 == 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conditional Expressions (if-then-else)\n",
    "- Scala's `if-else` statement is an expression, meaning it returns a value.\n",
    "- This allows for more concise code compared to languages where `if-else` is a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val result = if (x > 0) \"positive\" else \"non-positive\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Functions with Recursion\n",
    "- Scala supports recursion, where a function calls itself.\n",
    "- Recursion is a common technique in functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def factorial(n: Int): Int = {\n",
    "  if (n <= 1) 1\n",
    "  else n * factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "}\n",
    "val fact5 = factorial(5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Conditional Expressions (if-then-else)\n",
    "- Scala's `if-else` statement is an expression, meaning it returns a value.\n",
    "- This allows for more concise code compared to languages where `if-else` is a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val result = if (x > 0) \"positive\" else \"non-positive\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Nesting and Lexical Scope\n",
    "- Scala allows functions and variables to be defined within other functions, creating nested scopes.\n",
    "- Inner scopes have access to variables in outer scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def outerFunction(x: Int): Int = {\n",
    "  def innerFunction(y: Int): Int = x + y\n",
    "  innerFunction(5)\n",
    "}\n",
    "val result = outerFunction(10) // Result is 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Call by Name & Call by Value\n",
    "- Scala supports both call-by-value and call-by-name parameter evaluation strategies.\n",
    "- Call-by-value evaluates the argument before passing it to the function.\n",
    "- Call-by-name evaluates the argument only when it is used inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "def callByValue(x: Int): Unit = {\n",
    "  println(\"x1 = \" + x)\n",
    "  println(\"x2 = \" + x)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "def callByName(x: => Int): Unit = {\n",
    "  println(\"x1 = \" + x)\n",
    "  println(\"x2 = \" + x)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "callByValue({ println(\"evaluating\"); 10 }) // Prints \"evaluating\" once\n",
    "callByName({ println(\"evaluating\"); 10 })  // Prints \"evaluating\" twice\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Substitution Model\n",
    "The substitution model is a way to understand how function calls are evaluated in programming languages. It is a simple and intuitive method that helps explain the behavior of function calls and how they interact with the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the substitution model, when a function is called with arguments, the function body is substituted with the actual arguments passed to the function. This substitution continues until the expression can no longer be simplified, at which point the final value is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate the substitution model with a simple example in Scala:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "// Define a simple function\n",
    "def add(x: Int, y: Int): Int = {\n",
    "  x + y\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Call the function with arguments 3 and 4\n",
    "val result = add(3, 4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the substitution model, we can evaluate the function call `add(3, 4)` step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Replace `add(3, 4)` with `3 + 4` (substituting arguments into the function body).\n",
    "2. Evaluate `3 + 4` to get `7`.\n",
    "3. Return `7` as the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types and Variables in Scala\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type Inference\n",
    "- Scala has a powerful type inference system that can often infer the types of variables and expressions without explicit type annotations.\n",
    "- This allows for more concise code while maintaining strong typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Different Data Types\n",
    "- Scala supports various data types, including:\n",
    "  - Integers: `Int`, `Long`, `Short`, `Byte`\n",
    "  - Floating-point numbers: `Float`, `Double`\n",
    "  - Booleans: `Boolean`\n",
    "  - Characters: `Char`\n",
    "  - Strings: `String`\n",
    "  - Collections: `List`, `Set`, `Map`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "- In Scala, variables can be declared using the `var` keyword for mutable variables or `val` for immutable variables.\n",
    "- Mutable variables can have their values reassigned, while immutable variables cannot be reassigned once initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "// Type inference\n",
    "val x = 42 // Scala infers x as an Int\n",
    "val y: Double = 3.14 // Explicitly specify y as a Double\n",
    "\n",
    "// Different data types\n",
    "val name: String = \"Alice\"\n",
    "val age: Int = 30\n",
    "val isStudent: Boolean = true\n",
    "\n",
    "// Variables\n",
    "var mutableVar: Int = 10\n",
    "mutableVar = 20 // Allowed for mutable variables\n",
    "\n",
    "val immutableVar: Int = 100\n",
    "// immutableVar = 200 // Error: Cannot reassign immutable variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "- Scala's type inference reduces the need for explicit type annotations.\n",
    "- Scala supports various data types and provides flexibility in working with them.\n",
    "- Understanding the difference between mutable (`var`) and immutable (`val`) variables is important for writing safe and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lists**\n",
    "   - **Constructors of Lists:** Lists can be constructed in Scala using the `::` (cons) operator and `Nil` for the empty list. For example:\n",
    "     ```scala\n",
    "     val myList = 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: Nil\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Right Associativity:** The `::` operator is right-associative, which means that multiple elements can be added to the beginning of a list using multiple `::` operators.\n",
    "   - **List Operations:** Scala provides several operations for working with lists, such as `head` to get the first element, `tail` to get the rest of the list after the head, `isEmpty` to check if the list is empty, `length` to get the length of the list, `reverse` to reverse the list, `map` to apply a function to each element, `filter` to filter elements based on a predicate, `foldLeft` and `foldRight` for folding (aggregating) elements from left to right and right to left respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pure Data (Algebraic Data Types)**\n",
    "   - **Define Custom Data Types:** Scala allows you to define custom data types using `sealed trait` and `case class` or `case object`. This allows you to model your domain more effectively. For example:\n",
    "     ```scala\n",
    "     sealed trait Tree[A]\n",
    "     case class Leaf[A](value: A) extends Tree[A]\n",
    "     case class Branch[A](left: Tree[A], right: Tree[A]) extends Tree[A]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enums (Domain Modeling)**\n",
    "   - **Define Enums:** Enums can be defined in Scala using `sealed trait` and `case object`. This allows you to create a set of related constants that represent the possible values of a type. For example:\n",
    "     ```scala\n",
    "     sealed trait DayOfWeek\n",
    "     case object Monday extends DayOfWeek\n",
    "     case object Tuesday extends DayOfWeek\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Subtyping, Generics**\n",
    "   - **Subtyping:** Subtyping allows a subtype to be substituted for its supertype, ensuring that the program remains correct. Scala uses the `extends` keyword for class inheritance and the `<:` operator for type bounds.\n",
    "   - **Generics:** Scala supports generic types, allowing you to write code that works with different types. You can define generic classes, traits, and methods using square brackets `[]`. For example:\n",
    "     ```scala\n",
    "     class Cage[A <: Animal](animal: A)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bounds, Variance**\n",
    "   - **Bounds:** Bounds in Scala allow you to restrict the type of a generic parameter. You can specify upper bounds (`<:`) and lower bounds (`>:`) to define constraints on the type parameter.\n",
    "   - **Variance:** Variance in Scala specifies how subtyping of parameterized types relates to subtyping of their parameters. Variance can be covariant (`+`), contravariant (`-`), or invariant (no symbol).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Liskov Substitution Principle**\n",
    "   - The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle ensures that subtypes behave in a way that is consistent with the supertype.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Pair, Tuples, and Generic Methods**\n",
    "   - **Pair and Tuples:** Pair and tuples are used to group together elements of different types. They are immutable and can hold heterogeneous elements. For example:\n",
    "     ```scala\n",
    "     val pair: (Int, String) = (1, \"one\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Generic Methods:** Scala allows you to define generic methods that work with different types. You can define a method with type parameters inside square brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Higher-order List Functions**\n",
    "   - Scala provides higher-order functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions. Examples include `map`, `filter`, `foldLeft`, `foldRight`, etc. These functions allow you to work with lists in a functional way, applying transformations and aggregations.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Reduction of Lists**\n",
    "   - Reduction functions in Scala, such as `reduceLeft`, `foldLeft`, `foldRight`, and `reduceRight`, are used to combine elements of a list into a single value. These functions apply a binary operation to the elements of the list to produce a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Reasoning with Lists**\n",
    "    - **Laws of Concatenation:** Associativity (`(a ++ b) ++ c == a ++ (b ++ c)`) ensures that the result of concatenating multiple lists is the same regardless of the grouping.\n",
    "    - **Natural Induction:** Prove a property for an empty list and then for a list with one more element than a list for which the property holds.\n",
    "    - **Structural Induction:** Prove a property for an empty list and then for a list with one more element by assuming the property holds for the rest of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Referential Transparency**\n",
    "    - Referential transparency means that an expression can be replaced with its value without changing the program's behavior. This property allows for easier reasoning about the code and enables optimization by the compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Sequences, Vector, Range**\n",
    "    - Sequences in Scala are general interfaces for sequences of elements. `Vector` is an immutable, indexed sequence. `Range` represents a sequence of evenly spaced integers. These types provide various operations for working with sequences of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Combinatorial Search**\n",
    "    - Combinatorial search refers to the process of finding all possible combinations of a set of elements. This can be achieved using for-comprehensions in Scala, which allow you to iterate over collections and combine elements in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **For Expressions**\n",
    "    - For-expressions in Scala are used to iterate over collections and perform operations on elements. They can include generators (to specify the elements to iterate over), guards (to filter elements), and definitions (to introduce variables). For-expressions can be used to simplify code that involves iteration and transformation of collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Sets, Maps**\n",
    "    - Scala provides `Set` and `Map` collections for storing unique elements and key-value pairs respectively. Sets do not allow duplicate elements, and maps associate keys with values. Both sets and maps provide various operations for adding, removing, and accessing elements.\n"
