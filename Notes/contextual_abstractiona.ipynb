    "## **Contextual Abstractions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextual abstractions in Scala are a mechanism that allows functions or methods to behave differently based on implicit contextual information available in the current scope. This means that the behavior of a function can change depending on the implicit values or instances that are available at the point of invocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextual abstractions are implemented using implicit parameters or given instances. Implicit parameters are parameters that are marked as `implicit` in the function or method signature. When a function or method is called with implicit parameters, the Scala compiler looks for values that match the type of the implicit parameters in the current scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given instances are similar to implicit parameters but are defined using the `given` keyword. They allow you to provide implementations for type classes or other abstractions in a way that is more flexible and decoupled from the calling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextual abstractions are commonly used in Scala libraries and frameworks to achieve the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Provide Polymorphic Behavior:** By defining functions or methods that take implicit parameters, you can create polymorphic behavior that adapts based on the types of the implicit parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement Type Classes and Instances:** Type classes are a pattern in Scala for ad-hoc polymorphism. Contextual abstractions are used to define type classes and their instances, allowing you to define behavior for types outside of their definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define Default or Alternative Implementations:** Contextual abstractions allow you to define default implementations for functions or methods that can be overridden by providing alternative implementations in the current scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example that demonstrates the use of contextual abstractions in Scala:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "trait Printer[T] {\n",
    "  def print(value: T): Unit\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "object Printer {\n",
    "  // Default printer for strings\n",
    "  given defaultStringPrinter: Printer[String] {\n",
    "    def print(value: String): Unit = println(s\"Default Printer: $value\")\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  // Alternative printer for strings\n",
    "  given alternativeStringPrinter: Printer[String] {\n",
    "    def print(value: String): Unit = println(s\"Alternative Printer: $value\")\n",
    "  }\n",
    "\n",
    "  // Usage\n",
    "  def printString(value: String)(using printer: Printer[String]): Unit = {\n",
    "    printer.print(value)\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Usage\n",
    "import Printer._\n",
    "\n",
    "// Uses default printer\n",
    "printString(\"Hello, Scala!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "// Uses alternative printer\n",
    "printString(\"Hello, Scala!\")(using alternativeStringPrinter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `Printer` trait defines a type class for printing values. The `Printer` object contains two given instances for printing strings: `defaultStringPrinter` and `alternativeStringPrinter`. The `printString` method takes a string and an implicit `Printer[String]`, which determines the printer implementation to use. By changing the implicit `Printer[String]` in the current scope, you can switch between the default and alternative implementations."
