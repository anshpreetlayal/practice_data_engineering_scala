    "### Execution Context in Scala\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution context in Scala is a mechanism used in concurrent and asynchronous programming to manage the execution of tasks. It provides a way to control where and how tasks are executed, such as on different threads or thread pools. Execution context is essential for handling concurrency, parallelism, and non-blocking operations efficiently.\n",
