    "### Syntax\n",
    "Scala syntax is concise and resembles pseudo-code. It supports both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "// Object-oriented style\n",
    "class Person(name: String) {\n",
    "  def greet(): Unit = println(s\"Hello, $name!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Functional style\n",
    "val add = (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y\n",
    "println(add(3, 4)) // Output: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables and Data Types\n",
    "Scala has basic data types like Int, Double, Char, Boolean, etc. Variables are declared using `var` (mutable) or `val` (immutable).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val x: Int = 5\n",
    "var y: String = \"Hello\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "Functions are first-class citizens in Scala, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. They can also be defined anonymously (lambda functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val add = (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y\n",
    "println(add(3, 4)) // Output: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control Structures\n",
    "Scala supports if-else, while, do-while, and for loops. The `for` loop supports traditional and \"for-comprehension\" styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "for (i <- 1 to 5) {\n",
    "  println(i)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collections\n",
    "Scala provides collections like lists, sets, maps, tuples, etc., which can be manipulated using various methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "val doubled = numbers.map(_ * 2)\n",
    "println(doubled) // Output: List(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern Matching\n",
    "Pattern matching is used for handling complex conditional logic based on the structure of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val day = \"Monday\"\n",
    "day match {\n",
    "  case \"Monday\" => println(\"Start of the week\")\n",
    "  case \"Friday\" => println(\"End of the week\")\n",
    "  case _ => println(\"Some other day\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and Objects\n",
    "Scala supports classes, objects, fields, methods, and constructors, with support for inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "class Person(name: String) {\n",
    "  def greet(): Unit = println(s\"Hello, $name!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "val person = new Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "person.greet() // Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
