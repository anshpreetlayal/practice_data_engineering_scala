    "### **Syntax**\n",
    "Scala syntax is concise and resembles pseudo-code. It supports both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "// Object-oriented style\n",
    "class Person(name: String) {\n",
    "  def greet(): Unit = println(s\"Hello, $name!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Functional style\n",
    "val add = (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y\n",
    "println(add(3, 4)) // Output: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Variables and Data Types**\n",
    "Scala has basic data types like Int, Double, Char, Boolean, etc. Variables are declared using `var` (mutable) or `val` (immutable).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val x: Int = 5\n",
    "var y: String = \"Hello\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Functions**\n",
    "Functions are first-class citizens in Scala, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. They can also be defined anonymously (lambda functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val add = (x: Int, y: Int) => x + y\n",
    "println(add(3, 4)) // Output: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Control Structures in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "Scala provides several control structures for flow control in your programs. These include `if-else` expressions, `while` and `do-while` loops, and the powerful `for` loop with support for both traditional and \"for-comprehension\" styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. `if-else` Expression\n",
    "The `if-else` expression in Scala works similarly to other languages. It evaluates a condition and executes a block of code based on whether the condition is true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val x = 10\n",
    "val result = if (x > 5) \"greater\" else \"less or equal\"\n",
    "println(result) // Output: greater\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `while` Loop\n",
    "The `while` loop in Scala repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "var i = 0\n",
    "while (i < 5) {\n",
    "  println(i)\n",
    "  i += 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `do-while` Loop\n",
    "The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but it always executes the block of code at least once before checking the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "var i = 0\n",
    "do {\n",
    "  println(i)\n",
    "  i += 1\n",
    "} while (i < 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. `for` Loop\n",
    "Scala's `for` loop is very flexible and can be used in different styles. It can iterate over collections, ranges, and other sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Traditional Style**:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  for (i <- 1 to 5) {\n",
    "    println(i)\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For-comprehension Style**:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  val names = List(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\")\n",
    "  for (name <- names if name.length > 4) {\n",
    "    println(name)\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  **Pattern Matching**\n",
    "Pattern matching is a powerful control structure in Scala that allows you to match the structure of data and extract parts of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val day = \"Monday\"\n",
    "val kind = day match {\n",
    "  case \"Monday\" | \"Tuesday\" | \"Wednesday\" | \"Thursday\" | \"Friday\" => \"Weekday\"\n",
    "  case \"Saturday\" | \"Sunday\" => \"Weekend\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "println(kind) // Output: Weekday\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pattern matching is often used in conjunction with `match` expressions to handle different cases of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Collections in Scala**\n",
    "\n",
    "Scala provides a rich set of collections for working with data. These collections are grouped into mutable and immutable collections. Immutable collections cannot be modified once they are created, while mutable collections can be modified in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Lists\n",
    "- **Immutable**: Lists are ordered collections of elements of the same type. They are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed once the list is created.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "  val doubled = numbers.map(_ * 2)\n",
    "  println(doubled) // Output: List(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Sets\n",
    "- **Immutable and Mutable**: Sets are collections of unique elements. They can be either immutable or mutable.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  val set = Set(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "  val set2 = set + 6\n",
    "  println(set2) // Output: Set(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Maps\n",
    "- **Immutable and Mutable**: Maps are collections of key-value pairs. They can be either immutable or mutable.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  val map = Map(\"a\" -> 1, \"b\" -> 2, \"c\" -> 3)\n",
    "  val value = map(\"a\")\n",
    "  println(value) // Output: 1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Tuples\n",
    "- **Immutable**: Tuples are ordered collections of elements of different types. They are immutable.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  val tuple = (1, \"hello\", true)\n",
    "  println(tuple._2) // Output: hello\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Arrays\n",
    "- **Mutable**: Arrays are fixed-size collections that can be mutated. They are mutable.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  val array = Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "  array(2) = 10\n",
    "  println(array.mkString(\", \")) // Output: 1, 2, 10, 4, 5\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Seq\n",
    "- **Immutable and Mutable**: Seq is a trait for sequences, which represent ordered collections of elements. It can be either immutable or mutable.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  val seq = Seq(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "  val seq2 = seq :+ 6\n",
    "  println(seq2) // Output: List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Iterable\n",
    "- **Immutable and Mutable**: Iterable is a trait for iterable collections, which can be either immutable or mutable.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  ```scala\n",
    "  val iterable = Iterable(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "  val doubled = iterable.map(_ * 2)\n",
    "  println(doubled) // Output: List(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pattern Matching**\n",
    "Pattern matching is used for handling complex conditional logic based on the structure of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val day = \"Monday\"\n",
    "day match {\n",
    "  case \"Monday\" => println(\"Start of the week\")\n",
    "  case \"Friday\" => println(\"End of the week\")\n",
    "  case _ => println(\"Some other day\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Classes and Objects**\n",
    "Scala supports classes, objects, fields, methods, and constructors, with support for inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "class Person(name: String) {\n",
    "  def greet(): Unit = println(s\"Hello, $name!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "val person = new Person(\"Alice\")\n",
    "person.greet() // Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Traits**\n",
    "Traits are similar to interfaces in Java but can have default implementations and support mixin-style composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "trait Greeter {\n",
    "  def greet(): Unit\n",
    "}\n",
    "class Person(name: String) extends Greeter {\n",
    "  def greet(): Unit = println(s\"Hello, $name!\")\n",
    "}\n",
    "val person = new Person(\"Bob\")\n",
    "person.greet() // Output: Hello, Bob\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Singleton Objects**\n",
    "Singleton objects are similar to static classes in Java and are used for defining utility methods or representing a single instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "object MathUtil {\n",
    "  def square(x: Int): Int = x * x\n",
    "}\n",
    "println(MathUtil.square(5)) // Output: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Type Inference**\n",
    "Scala has a powerful type inference system, which can often infer types without explicit annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val x = 5 // Compiler infers x as Int\n",
    "val y = \"Hello\" // Compiler infers y as String\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Arithmetic and Boolean Expressions**\n",
    "Arithmetic expressions in Scala are similar to most programming languages, supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Boolean expressions involve logical operations such as AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val x = 10\n",
    "val y = 5\n",
    "val sum = x + y\n",
    "val isGreater = x > y\n",
    "val isTrue = true && false\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Evaluations and Operators**\n",
    "In Scala, expressions are evaluated based on operator precedence and associativity rules. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val result = 1 + 2 * 3 // Multiplication has higher precedence\n",
    "println(result) // Output: 7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Infix Notation**\n",
    "Scala allows certain methods to be called using infix notation, where the method name appears between the object and the argument. This is commonly used for mathematical operations and other binary operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val x = 10\n",
    "val y = 5\n",
    "val sum = x + y // Infix notation for the + method\n",
    "println(sum) // Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Precedence Rules**\n",
    "Scala follows standard operator precedence rules, where certain operators are evaluated before others. For example, multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val result = 1 + 2 * 3 // Multiplication has higher precedence\n",
    "println(result) // Output: 7\n",
    "```"
